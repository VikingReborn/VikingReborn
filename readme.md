# VikingUI Reborn

This is a fork of [vikinghug's](https://github.com/vikinghug) original work. I
found the original multi-repo layout to get in the way, and have put everything
into a single repository that holds everything. Sadly, that meant losing the
original commit history unless I was to do some serious git-gymnastics.
